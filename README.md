# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
## How to start run locally
* `yarn` To install node_modules
* `yarn start` Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000]

## How to run unit tests locally
* `yarn test` Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

## Comments For peer programmer
###  Acceptance Criteria
* Above the essay, create a feedback section that asks users for a 1-5 star rating on the essay, then a 1-5 star rating about the site
* If the user submitted 5 stars for both, ask the user to leave us a review on a 3rd party (like TrustPilot). 
* Please track when the user clicks “leave us a review” (an example api to backend would be fine).

### Programmer comments and review
#### DONE:
* UI for the feedback section is there.
* Logic for button appearance for review
* I also have added the test for the written line of code
#### TODO:
* Integration of the trustPilot api review
* Backend Integration
